					<h3>The Bride</h3>
					<h2>Heather Payne</h2>
					<p>Anancy, is only eight legs you have. Where you get 40 legs from? Bredda Lion asked confused. Bredda Lion mi fren. Anyting is possible, because I do not know what di trousis foot Bredda Donkey know bout baking patty! If him can have a patty shop, den I can have 40 legs! Anancy argued. A true ting enoh Anancy, because I would tink di only ting dat Bredda Donkey know how to bake is jackass carn – but not patty! Anancy then said, next thing this GPS is going to tell mi fi look out fi Bredda Fowl fry chicken restaurant. But wait…talking about Bredda Fowl, is a long time I don’t see him running around the place enoh. Wonda if im sick?” You know Anancy, I don’t see im at all since im come back fram country di odda day enoh. Im did lose a couple feada an im did get mawga, soh maybe im sick fi true,” Bredda Lion responded.</p>

					<h3>The Groom</h3>
					<h2>Shawn Konopinsky</h2>
					<p>Im most famous ting pan di menu is, rat bat soup, Bredda Lion explained. The GPS added, yes boss, Bredda Rat a big time chef dese days. Now, in another two minute, I want yuh to look out for Bredda Puss Fry Fish place. Yuh cyaan miss it.”This time Brother Lion is caught by surprise. Bredda Puss can fry fish? Since when?” he asked in disbelief. Anancy replied with a big grin, but wait, you never know seh Bredda Puss a fish tief? If I was a betting man, I would bet seh every last bit of fish im fry in dat place, is tief im tief it.</p>

					<p>Bredda Anancy puts the car in gear and charged down the road. A few minutes later, sure enough, he saw Bredda Jancrow sitting on a bench selling dead meat by the pound at the side of the road. Just then, the GPS gave him another direction. Now, buss the left here soh and drive for about 200 feet an mek a right turn when yuh come to one big, red building. Dat is Bredda Rat famous restaurant.</p>

					<h2>Our Story</h2>
					<p>Once upon a time, Brother Anancy and his good friend, Brother Lion were hungry and were in the mood for something tasty to eat. They decided that they wanted to have some chicken at Island Grill. Brother Anancy had just bought a sporty new car and offered to drive. But there was only one problem. Brother Anancy did not know how to get to Island Grill by car. Luckily, Brother Anancy's new car came equipped with a Jamaican GPS Navigation system. He was certain the GPS could get him to the restaurant.</p>

					<p>After he and Bredda Lion settled in the vehicle, he turned on the GPS. The voice of the GPS blared through the speakers with a husky male voice. Where di two a unu going? the GPS asked. Bredda Anancy replied, Mister GPS, mi an mi fren want to get to Island Grill to get something to eat. But we don’t know how to get there from here. Can yuh give us di directions , please? No problem man! Is easy drive dat. Put the car in gear and head down the road until yuh get to Bredda Jancrow food stall,” the GPS instructed.</p>

					<p>Bredda Anancy is shocked and amazed. Breddda Jancrow have a food stall? Whateva food im selling must smell bad, because as far as I know, jancrow love dead meat, Anancy asserted. Yes man, I know about that stall very well, Anancy, Bredda Lion said. Every time one of the animals dead in the district, Jancrow set up di food stall.” Yuh si what a tell yuh! I know what I am talking about, the GPS remarked. Soh drive down the road til yuh get to Bredda Jancrow food stall. Yuh cyaan miss it!</p>
